# BlenderCODTool
A Blender (4.1+) plugin for importing/exporting XModels and XAnims

It's a continuation for the original Blender 3.0 addon by SE2Dev and CoDEmanX, it handles deprecated features, fixes unsupported material names, and aims to add XCam/Siege model support, enhancing its utility for map creators.
